# Regression refresher: score ~ bty_avg
# Sampling scenario around regression case; n = 463 is a sample
# 463 teacher(s) assumed to be representative sample of greater population (e.g., all instructors at UT Austin)
# (always need more knowledge of sampling methodology)
# "estimate" in the regression table is a point estimate of population slope    (0.067)
# "estimate" in the regression table is a point estimate of population intercept (3.880)
# the "best fitting line" is an ESTIMATE of some true (and unknowable) POPULATION LINE
# Hence, Scenario for sampling inference (population regression slope & fitted regression slope)
